# Train Schedule

A train schedule in which users add train information in a form, such as freqency and first train time, from which time variables are calculated using the Moment.js library, including next arrival time. These variables are stored in a Firebase Realtime database and pulled from this database and displayed in a table as a row of data which is visible from different browsers.
